The consolidated power consumption for a commercial complex is sent in the following format by EB department for a month. The complex has 5 shops each having a separate meter box and the electricity tariff total for a month has to be calculated for each shop separately based on the number of units consumed.
NOTE: The same shop may have more than one entry in a single line.
Sometimes if a shop does not consume energy it will not be part of the list
On power shutdown days the entry will be nothing just the date
